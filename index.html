 <p> My name is Makayla Cordova, I was born and raised in colorado. I started
    coding when I was in middle school, in a Pre Engineering and Computer Science
    class using the Scratch Website. I have also taken an AP high school Computer
    Science class along with being in an Engineering STEM Pathway where I learned
    some robotics coding. I have also taken a college coding class where I learned
    a little bit of C, C#, and C++. Outside of coding I enjoy reading manga and 
    books by Osamu Dazai, a Japanese Author. I also Enjoy Drawing and Painting 
    along with various other kinds of art.
